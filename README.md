# Steak N Blog

## Description

This website helped me understood the importance of local storage and data management. I solved the problem of gathering user's input data into the local storage to help me use that same data and create another webpage. Managing information by using the local storage is a great way to keep data in order and displayed however the manager of the website wants to display it.

I also learned and applied how to toggle a dark/light mode for webpages.
